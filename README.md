# quotes

A presentation of inspirational quotes at somewhat random intervals, making use of the FullScreen API. Also switches to dark mode every 3 1/2 minutes, 
and plays a video every fifteen minutes.

One really cool feature of this project is that you can add new quotes in real time to the input form (while the presentation is playing on a different device), 
and the quote will pop up on the screen a few seconds later.
This project was made for Celebrand and used for a company event.
